<h1>How to make an IDE for your own language?</h1> 
<hr />

<p>This topic shows how to create your own portable package of SynWrite which will support
your custom programming language. As an example, you may look at ready one, which is called
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/forums/forum/629990/topic/4769315" target="_blank"><b>GCB@Syn</b></a>, and supports GCBasic language.

<ul>
<li> Unpack "SynWrite.rar" archive (you may download it at homepage) to a folder, e.g. "C:\SynWrite".
  <br />Make this installation portable by creating an empty file "Portable.ini" in this folder.
<p>
<li> Delete files which won't be used in your package. These are:
  <ul>
  <li> "Syn2.wlx" (Total Commander plugin).
  <li> maybe "Dictionaries" folder if you don't need spell-checker feature.
  <li> unneeded language files from "Lang" folder.
  <li> maybe "Plugins" folder. If you delete "Plugins" folder, you may also delete file "SynPlugins.sample.ini" in "C:\SynWrite". 
  <li> maybe "Readme" folder, maybe you only want to keep "SynWrite.chm" as this file is called by Help buttons from some dialogs.
  <li> some content from "Data" folder:
    <ul>
    <li>"clips" folder is for "Text Clips" panel
    <li>"colors" folder is for Options dialog color presets 
    <li>"newdoc" folder is for command "File -- New" 
    <li>etc
    </ul>  
  <li> maybe most of tools from "Tools" folder (e.g. ColorPicker.exe, Tidy.exe, Emmet.js etc) or entire "Tools" folder.
  <li> file "Tidy.cfg" if commands "HTML Tidy" isn't needed.
  <li> file "Pluginst.inf". 
  </ul>
<p>
<li> Run SynWrite, open Lexer Library dialog ("Options -- Customize lexer library") and delete unneeded lexers.
  Then save the library. File "LexLib.lxl" should become way too smaller.
  <br />Also delete unneeded ACP files from "Data\autocomplete" folder.
<p></p>  
<li> Import your own needed lexers (e.g. "GreatCowBasic" for GCB@Syn) into Lexer Library.  
  <br />Put corresponding ACP files (if any) to "Data\autocomplete" folder. 
<p></p>
<li> It's very good idea to hide unneeded (e.g. HTML-related) menu items in UI. You can hide menu items using "SynHide.ini" file,
  read help topic about it. 
<p>
<li> Run SynWrite, open "Options -- External tools" dialog, and create your own items for compilers, BAT files, Help files, etc.
   <ul>
   <li>It's a good idea to preconfigure also compilers output patterns - users then can jump from compilers error messages into
   source code error line.
   <li>It's a good idea to create an item for your own language CHM file with F1 key.
   </ul>
<p>
<li> Don't forget to delete unneeded INI files from "C:\SynWrite" before packing this folder.<br />
  Leave Syn.ini with preconfigured tools and options.<br />
  Delete SynState.ini and SynStyles.ini and SynSpell*. 
</ul>

<hr />
<br />
<p>That's mostly all. GCB@Syn package also adds tool IDE.exe, which sets the GCB env-variable, so external tools can be preconfigured
using this env-variable (ide.exe is launcher for Syn.exe). This may be needed if you want to call tools from outside of Syn folder.
