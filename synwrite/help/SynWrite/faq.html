<h3>How to import/export lexers.</h3>
<p>You can export/import lexers to/from text files. Such files are written in "Delphi resources" format
and have extension "lcf".</p>
<p>1st method:</p>
<ul>
<li> Activate needed lexer (in Lexer menu)
<li> Call menu command "Options -- Customize lexer"
<li> In the opened "Lexer properties" dialog press Export or Import button
<li> (Note: import will overwrite selected lexer from chosen file)
</ul>
<p>Alternative method:</p>
<ul>
<li> (No need to select lexer first)
<li> Call menu command "Options -- Customize lexer library"
<li> In the opened "Lexer library" dialog click needed lexer, then press "Import lexer" or "Export lexer" toolbar button
<li> (Note: import will not overwrite selected lexer, new lexer will be created)
</ul>

<a name="speed">
<h3>To speed-up program start:</h3>
<p>Open "Options -- Customize lexer library" dialog, and delete (not just disable!) unneeded lexers.
Then save the lexer library.</p>

<p>After you have customized the lexer library, save its copy under different name:
old name is "LexLib.lxl", new name may be "MyLib.lxl" (it's recommended to place it into the same folder,
so "Syn.ini" key will not contain path).
You can create such copy using "Save lexer library with another name" button in the "Lexer library" dialog.
After that, make sure you activated your new library: press "Choose another lexer library" button
in the "Lexer library" dialog, and browse for your new file.
</p>

<p>You should also turn off the following options in the Options dialog:
<ul>
<li> "Spell Check" tab -- "Enable live spell cheking"
<li> "History" tab -- "Remove non-existing items from recents list at startup"
</ul>
</p>

<h3>To speed-up editor redrawing:</h3>
<p>Turn off these options:
<ul>
<li> "View Settings" tab -- "Show horizontal ruler"
<li> "Select/Highlight" tab -- "Highlight pair brackets"
</ul>
</p>

<a name="iniloc">
<h3>How to make app portable / How to copy settings to another PC.</h3>
<p>Since last versions, app is always portable - settings are stored in ini-files in "Settings" subfolder
of program folder. (File "portable.ini" not needed.) <br />
Note: do not install app to "Program Files", default install-folder is "C:\SynWrite".
</p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="colors">
<h3>How to adjust program colors.</h3>
<p>To change SynWrite interface colors:
</p>
<ul>
<li> call "Options" dialog, "Colors" tab
<li> change the toolbar theme and/or interface items' colors
</ul>

<p>To change colors of lexers' elements:
</p>
<ul>
<li> call needed lexer in Lexer menu
<li> call command "Options -- Customize lexer styles"
<li> for needed items change their colors/fonts
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="two_files">
<h3>To open two files side-by-side:</h3>
<p>
Use the <a href="groups.html">Groups of tabs</a> feature: set grouping mode to "2 horizontally", then drag any tab from 1st group to 2nd one.<br />
If needed, you may use toolbar commands "Sync vertical scrolling"/"Sync horizontal scrolling"
to synchronize scrolling of active tabs in groups 1 and 2.
</p>

<h3>To split view of a single file:</h3>
<p>Right-click tab header and call popup menu command "Split this tab".
You may also split tab horizontally, using splitter's popup menu.
</p>

<a name="keep_own">
<h3>How to keep lexers settings on app reinstalling.</h3>
<p>You can keep your own lexer settings, using one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If you just need to keep customized lexer's styles: you can reinstall SynWrite and
then perform command "Options -- Advanced -- Restore lexer styles". This command
restores your custom styles from SynStyles.ini file, which is auto-saved on every
OK button press in Lexer properties dialog.
<p>
<li> If you need to keep entire lexer config (including internal lexer tweaks):
you can export your custom lexer to a file,
and after SynWrite reinstalling you can import it back.
See <a href="#q0">Export/Import</a> topic.
<p>
<li> If you have created new lexer library file and activated it (using "Choose another lexer library" button
in the "Lexer library" dialog), then don't worry about reinstalling - your custom library file
won't be changed.
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
<a name="column_mode">
<h3>Is there a "Column Mode" command like in Notepad++.</h3>
<p>Yes, it's command "Edit -- Edit column". It places multi-selections for selected column block,
so you may type new block content.
After finished with typing, do a simple click out of block, to cancel multi-carets mode.

<p>Note: "Edit column" has no special shortcut, you can use shortcut for other command
  "Edit -- Multi-carets -- Carets from selection, left edge", which is used internally for "Edit column" command.
</p>

<p>
<a name="fonts">
<h3>What monospaced fonts are good for program.</h3>
<p>Default font "Consolas" looks good in Windows Vista/7/8.
But you may try other monospaced fonts for use in SynWrite:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Lucida Console
<li> Liberation Mono
</ul>

<p>Lucida Console is part of Windows. To add Liberation font,
download <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/" target=_blank>ttf package</a> and
install "LiberationMono-Regular.ttf".
</p>

<p>Note: for better readability it's suggested to set option "Line spacing" to value 1 or 2.
</p>

<p>

<p>
<a name="guides">
<h3>How to disable "indentation guides".</h3>
<p>To hide indentation guides (vertical lines, which show syntax blocks such as "{...}" in C language),
you need to use option "View Settings -- Block staples".
</p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="html_spell">
<h3>How to hide red underlines for misspelled HTML tags.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Activate HTML lexer
<li> Call dialog "Options -- Customize lexer" (for HTML lexer)
<li> Click "Styles" tab of dialog; you'll see two styles "Tag id - underlines", "Tag attrib - underlines";
  click them and change their color/underline styles on the right side of dialog
<li> Save lexer library when prompted
</ul>

<p>You can keep your styles on SynWrite reinstalling - see <a href="#keep_own">another question</a>.
</p>

<p>You may need to do the same for "PHP_dev_HTML" lexer (HTML sublexer of PHP(dev) lexer).
To call properties of this lexer, go into "Options -- Customize lexer library" dialog.
</p>

<h3>How to create SynWrite translation.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Download <a target=_blank href="http://yktoo.com/">DKLang Translation Editor</a>
<li> In Translation Editor open "Readme\Syn.dklang" file. Create your new LNG file.
<li> Put your LNG file into "Lang" subfolder of SynWrite folder, select it in Options dialog and test it.
<li> Send your file to contact email (About box).
</ul>

<a name="name">
<h3>Program name.</h3>
<p>
In march 2010, there was a usual Total Commander plugin named "Syn2".
Name "Syn2" appeared from famous Delphi component named SynEdit.
"2" meaned that plugin was rewritten (by first author Alexander Ryabov) using another Delphi component, EControl.
</p>
<p>
Syn2 was forked by me, Alexey, and our first version was "Syn2 v2.1". After some time we began to search for new name,
and Matthias (sourceforge project admin) gave few variants: SynPad, SynText, SynWrite etc etc...
and we have chosen "SynWrite".
</p>

<p>
<a name="lexfontsize">
<h3>How to change font size for specific lexer.</h3>
<p>Open "Lexer library" dialog (command "Options -- Customize lexer library"),
select needed lexer and double-click it to open lexer properties dialog.
In the lexer properties dialog create "Default" style, if it's not created yet:
</p>
<ul>
<li> activate tab "Styles" and create new style,
<li> rename style to "Default" using edit-field below the styles list,
<li> for this new style set "Style type" = "Custom font",
<li> button "Set custom font" is enabled now, press it and choose needed font.
</ul>
<p>You have a style with custom font attached. Now activate dialog tab "Common" and
set option "Default style" to this style.
</p>

<p>

<p>
<a name="plugini">
<h3>How to assign lexers/shortcuts to command plugins.</h3>
<p>
First, call menu command "Options -- Advanced -- Edit file SynPlugins.ini". In file SynPlugins.ini find section [Commands] and needed plugin line.
Example:

<div class="code">
JS Format\Format=py:syn_js_format;run;JavaScript,JSON;Ctrl+Alt+F;
</div>

<p>
After "=" char are ";"-separated values.<br /> 
Lexers list (","-separated) is 3rd value (in example: JavaScript, JSON).<br /> 
Shortcut is 4th value (in example: Ctrl+Alt+F).<br />  
You can also assign key-combination like [Ctrl+Q, Q, B] - separate key-combo with "|" char:
<span class="code">Ctrl+Q|Q|B</span>
<p>
