<p>This project was initially started for building an editor based on the powerful
<a href="http://www.econtrol.ru/" target="_blank">EControl Syntax Editor SDK</a>.
In the very beginning SynWrite was only a Total Commander Lister plugin with less features.
Over the time it became a versatile and reliable standalone editor. Now it competes with other
major editors and is still trying to introduce new unique features.
