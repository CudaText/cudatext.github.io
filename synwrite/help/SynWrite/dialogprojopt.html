<h1>Dialog "Project Properties"</h1>
<hr />

<p>This dialog is called by "gear" toolbar button of "Project Manager" panel. It allows to change the following
properties of currently opened project. These options are saved in the project file.
</p>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td width="200">Encoding / Line ends / Lexer</td>
		<td>Properties of new documents, which are applied to the newly created documents when the project is loaded.
          They override the same settings from the main SynWrite configuration, if non-default values are chosen.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Working folder</td>
		<td>Initial folder for file/folder browse dialogs for project: "Add files", "Add folder contents".
            <br>The working folder is referred by <span class="inlinecode">{ProjectWorkDir}</span> variable in external tools dialog.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Main file</td>
		<td>Full path of project's main file. Must be changed using project tree context menu, command "Set as main file".
            <br>The main file is referred by <span class="inlinecode">{ProjectMainFileName}</span> variable in external tools dialog.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Files sorting</td>
		<td>Specifies sorting mode for the project, which is considered by "Add folder contents" dialog.
           If sorting is disabled, the mentioned dialog won't sort added folders, which is much faster for big folders.
           Note: you may sort folders manually using project context menu.
        </td>  
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Search paths</td>
		<td>Lists of folders, which are searched by command "Open by selection" of editor context menu
            (i.e. if you select word "wwww" in editor, context menu item "Open wwww" will appear).
           This list appends the folders list configurable in main SynWrite options.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>User variables</td>
		<td>List of lines in the form:
          <span class="inlinecode">VarName=some text</span>,
          which initialize user variables for external tools. In the properties of external tools
          you can refer to such variables as <span class="inlinecode">{VarName}</span>.
          Don't use ";" char inside this option text.<br />
          Special lines can specify additional <a href="helperacp.html#fm">auto-completion lists</a> for any lexers: 
             <span class="inlinecode">AC[LexerName]=c:\path\MyCompletions.acp</span> ; 
             path of file may be omitted if file is located in the same folder as project file.
