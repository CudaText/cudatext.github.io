<h1>Project Manager</h1>

</ul>

<a name="in"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>To call Project Manager in SynWrite, use one of the following:
<ul>
<li> open the left panel (with syntax tree) and click "Project" tab below the tree;
<li> use command "Window -- Panels -- Project panel".
</ul>
</p>

<p>Project Manager allows to group files into project structure/tree, which then
can be saved to disk in a single file (only listing of files/folders is saved, not files themselves).
Project files have "synw-proj" extension.
</p>

</p>

<p>The following toolbar buttons are present in Project Manager:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Open project file
<li> Save project file
<li> Add empty (virtual) folder
<li> Add disk folder's contents
<li> Add disk file(s)
<li> Rename current folder
<li> Delete selected items
<li> Open selected items in editor
<li> Open <a href="dialogprojopt.html">"Project properties" dialog</a> or "Project tools" dialog
</ul>

<p>Projects can be made portable in such a way: put all data files into subfolders of a single folder;
and save SynWrite project file into the same folder. Then this data folder is "portable" - you can move it
and reopen SynWrite project file with no file paths correction.
</p>
<br>

<a name="dnd"><h2>Drag&drop in project tree</h2></a>

<p>The following kinds of tree nodes' drag&drop are possible in the project tree:
</p>
<ul>
<li>drop node(s) on folder, usual - moves items inside the target folder;
<li>drop node(s) on folder, with Alt key pressed - moves items above the target folder (into the same level as target);
<li>drop node(s) on file - moves items above the target file (into the same level as target).
</ul>

<p>You can drag&drop files and folders from Windows Explorer into the project tree. This will add
items to the project (considering current tree node selection). When you drop a folder,
additional "Add folder to project" dialog apears.
</p>
<br>

<a name="pre"><h2>"Preview" panel</h2></a>

<p>There is "Preview current project file" panel, just press Space while in Project Manager to show/hide this panel.
It shows selected project file contents in a temporary read-only editor.
You can dock panel to the edge of main SynWrite window.
Use button "Open in editor" on this panel to open previewed file for editing.
</p>
