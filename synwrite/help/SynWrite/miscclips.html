<a name="in"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>Clips are small text fragments, which are grouped by folders.
They are not binded to any lexers.
</p>

</center>
</p>

<p>To call clips, first activate the Clips panel by menu command "Window -- Panels -- Text Clips panel",
then select desired folder in the panel combobox. 
Double-click panel items to insert clips into editor.
You have context menu to perform some actions on clips.
</p>

<p>Note: to display all Unicode characters in the Clips panel, you need to use rich font, such as Tahoma 
(Options dialog, "Fonts" tab, button "Output panel").
</p>

<p>There are clips of such kinds: </p>
<ul>
<li>Text-collections. Files with "txt" extension, each can contain any number of clips, one clip per line.
<li>Usual snippets. Files with "synw-snippet" extension <a href="snippets.html">described here</a>. Lexers of snippets are ignored here.
</ul>

<p>Files are located in the subfolders of "Data\clips" subfolder of SynWrite installation folder.
Each subfolder name is a group shown in Clips panel, if it's not empty.
Any number of files is allowed in one folder.
</p>

<br>
<a name="txt">
<h2>Format of text-collection</h2></a>

<p>File encoding is ANSI or UTF-16 with BOM.
Simple format: one line is one clip. Each line has format:<br>

<div class="code">NameStr=ValueStr</div>
or without "=" char:<br> 
<div class="code">ValueStr</div>
</p>

<ul>
<li>To use char "=" not as separator, just escape it as "\=".
<li>Inside value, special characters "\n" mean line breaks.
</ul>

<br>
<a name="hotkey">
<h2>List hotkeys</h2></a>

<p>Predefined clips don't have hotkeys, but you can add them in your clips. 
Such hotkey moves focus to its clip, while Clips panel listbox is focused.<br />
For this purpose save clip name with "[N]" substring, where "N" is a single letter or digit hotkey. 
Even for snippet format you can add such hotkey inside snippet name.
