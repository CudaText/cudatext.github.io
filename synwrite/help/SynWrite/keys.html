<h1>Key Shortcuts</h1>
<hr />
<p>You can assign hotkeys to all editor commands. 
You can use simple hotkeys - e.g. Ctrl+K or Ctrl+Shift+Up, or key combinations (combos) -
e.g. [Ctrl+K, Ctrl+B] or [Ctrl+Q, Q, A].
</p>

<p>
To assign key-combo to a command, in the "Keys" part of Options dialog:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Place selection on needed command in commands list. 	
<li> Enter simple hotkey in the field below the list, press "Set hotkey" button.
<li> Enter next simple hotkey in the same field, press "Extend hotkey" button.
     You will see that commands list now shows extended key-combo.  
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li> While working with the editor, you should type key-combos quickly (within 1 sec). 
<li> Key-combos work only when the editor tab is focused, but not some SynWrite panel.
     For example, if you assign a combo to "Find dialog" command, it won't work in additional panels.
<li> Ctrl/Alt/Shift modifiers are ignored for 2nd/3rd/etc combo parts.
	 So [Ctrl+K, Ctrl+B] is the same as [Ctrl+K, Alt+B], is the same as [Ctrl+K, Ctrl+Shift+B].
	 This is controlled by hidden option (see file "Readme\HiddenOptions.txt").
</ul>
