<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Multi-carets feature allows to add many carets (text blinking cursors), using one of the methods:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Click on any position with Ctrl key pressed.
<li> Click on any position ("beginning"), then click on another line ("ending") with Ctrl+Shift keys pressed:
     this will add multiple carets aligned in a column.
<li> Make a several lines selection (stream or column), then use commands "Edit -- Multi-carets -- Carets from selection...". 
<li> Make a search with placing search marks, then use commands "Edit -- Multi-carets -- Carets from search marks...". 
</ul>

<p>Most of important editor commands work synchroniously on all carets positions:
<ul>
<li> carets moving: Left/ Right/ Up/ Down/ Home/ End/ Ctrl+Left (move word left)/ Ctrl+Right (move word right).
<li> text typing and deleting.
<li> clipboard operations: Copy/ Cut/ Paste, they operate on all lines with carets.
<li> special actions: delete word left/ delete word right/ 
  delete line/ indent line/ unindent line/ delete to line start/ delete to line end.
</ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>
 
<ul>
<li> To cancel multi-carets mode, just click without Ctrl pressed.
<li> To remove a caret, just click it again with Ctrl pressed.
<li> Lines with carets are marked on gutter with different color.
<li> When several carets move to the same position, "duplicate" carets are discarded.
<li> When only one caret is left, multi-carets mode is deactivated and "usual" caret appears.
<li> These commands cancel multi-carets mode: Ctrl+A, Shift+Alt+arrows.
<li> These commands ignore multi-carets mode and just scroll the view: PageUp, PageDown, Ctrl+Home, Ctrl+End.
<li> Multi-carets feature can be disabled in the Options dialog. 
</ul>
