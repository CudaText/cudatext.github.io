<h1>Indentation-based folding</h1>
<hr />

<p>SynWrite supports folding based on indentation levels of lines. 
Example lexer is Python, see how it's configured. The following tweaks must be applied
to lexer in order to support indent-based folding:</p>

<ul>
<li> uncheck lexer property "Skip spaces while parsing".
<li> delete ending rules, just set "Close block at text end" option for opening rules.
<li> set "Group index" to 20 for opening rules (20 is special constant which tells
SynWrite that this rule is indent-aware).
<li> add new parsers, which will catch 1st word in each line with leading spaces and tabs.
See how it's done in Python lexer, 3 parsers are added there: "Word1stXXXXXXX" 
(1st of them is for class/function tree items, 2nd is for if/for/while blocks, and 3rd is for all other words).
<li> move these new parsers to the top of parsers list.
<li> set token types names, for new parsers (which catch leading spaces+tabs) to "1nnnnnnnn" (first char is "1", others are any).
<li> in "Rules" tab -- select rule which detects keywords -- select "Conditions" tab -- select 
listbox item with "[x] Identifier" condition checked -- add to it "[x] 1st word" checked too 
("1st word" is an example, you may have "1nnnnnn").
</ul>

<p>Note: tab character is counted as 4 spaces, when calculating indent levels. This is default for Python.</p>
